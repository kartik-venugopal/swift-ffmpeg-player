# swift-ffmpeg

## What ?

A basic audio player project that demonstrates the fundamentals of decoding audio with ffmpeg for the purpose of real-time playback. The code is in Swift 
and the demo project will run on macOS, but could prove educational even to programmers of different languages/platforms.

### What else ?

You will find a bare bones AVAudioEngine setup here. < 100 lines of code with just a player that schedules buffers.

## Who ?

Are you totally new to ffmpeg ? You just read/heard that there is this awesome library that plays everything and now you want to get started programming with it ? Great, you will like this.

Are you totally new to AVAudioEngine and you want to see a basic usage of it ? Great, you will find it here. For a more full-fledged AVAudioEngine setup, I point you to my other (far bigger) project: [Aural Player](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player)

If there are others like me out there who are dying to harness the awesome power of ffmpeg and develop their own audio apps, I'd like to at least give them enough
to get started on their addictive journey!

## Why ?

It seems that there aren't too many similar beginner-level demo projects or tutorials out there. The few that I found there were much too overwhelming.
I know that I myself searched and researched for almost 3 whole years to finally learn enough to write this basic player demo app.

That said, I have shared links, below, to much bigger, more comprehensive, and more detailed demos/projects/tutorials out there, which I myself learned from.

## Please note ...

This minimalist project is intended only as a quick start guide for beginners wanting to get their hands dirty programming with ffmpeg. I am not trying to educate those of you who have been taming ffmpeg for years.

This is NOT a comprehensive ffmpeg reference.
This is NOT a full-fledged audio player application.
